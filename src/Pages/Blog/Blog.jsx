            <h3 className='text-2xl '>1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h3>
            <p className='mb-4'><span className='font-bold'>Access Token:</span> An access token is a credential that is used to authenticate and authorize access to specific resources or APIs. It is typically issued by an authentication server (such as an OAuth 2.0 server) after a user successfully authenticates and grants permission to an application. The access token is then sent by the client (usually in the header of an HTTP request) to the resource server whenever it wants to access a protected resource.</p>
            <p className='mb-4'><span className='font-bold'>Refresh Token:</span> A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is also issued by the authentication server along with the access token. Its purpose is to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server.</p>
            <p className='font-semibold mb-4'>Access tokens and refresh tokens work together in a multi-step process to authenticate and authorize access to resources. Here's an overview of how they typically work:</p>
            <ul className='mt-4 ps-4'>
                <li>* Authentication: The client initiates the authentication process by sending the user to an authentication server (e.g., OAuth 2.0 server). The user enters their credentials (e.g., username and password) and the server verifies them.</li>
                <li>* Access Token Issuance: If the user's credentials are valid, the authentication server generates an access token and issues it to the client. The access token contains information about the user's identity and permissions.</li>

            </ul>
            <p className='font-semibold mb-4 mt-4'>Now, regarding storage on the client-side, it is essential to follow secure practices to protect access and refresh tokens. Here are some recommendations:</p>
            <ul className='ps-4'>
                <li>* Access Token Storage: Access tokens should be stored securely on the client-side. One common approach is to store them in memory as a variable during the user's session. This approach allows easy access and retrieval of the access token within the client's code. However, it's crucial to avoid storing access tokens in insecure storage mechanisms, such as local storage or cookies, as they can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
                <li>* Refresh Token Storage: Refresh tokens are more sensitive and have a longer lifespan, so they require stronger protection. It is generally recommended to store refresh tokens securely, such as in an encrypted and authenticated storage mechanism, such as a secure HTTP-only cookie or a secure local storage on the client-side.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className='text-2xl mt-4 mb-4 '>2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h3>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, schema, query languages, and use cases. Here's a comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases:</p>
            <h3 className='font-semibold mb-4'>1. Data Model:</h3>
            <ul className='ps-4 mb-4'>
                <li>* SQL: SQL databases use a structured, tabular data model with predefined schemas. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.</li>
                <li>* NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph models. They offer flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data storage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className='font-semibold mb-4'>2. Schema:</h3>
            <ul className='ps-4 mb-4'>
                <li>* SQL: SQL databases have a rigid, predefined schema that determines the structure and types of data stored in each table. Any changes to the schema require altering the table structure and may involve downtime during the migration process.</li>
                <li>* NoSQL: NoSQL databases typically have a flexible schema or no schema at all. They allow for the storage of different types of data within the same collection or document, making it easier to handle evolving and unstructured data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className='text-2xl mb-4'>3. What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h3>
            <p className='font-semibold mb-4'>Here are some key features and concepts associated with Express.js:</p>
            <ul className='ps-4 mb-4'>
                <li>* Routing: Express.js allows you to define routes for handling HTTP requests. It supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Routes are defined using a combination of a URL pattern and a corresponding handler function that executes when a matching request is received.</li>
                <li>* Middleware: Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can perform tasks like modifying request/response, parsing data, handling authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Middleware functions can be chained together, allowing for modular and reusable code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='font-semibold mb-4'>Here are some key features and concepts associated with NestJS:</p>
            <ul className='ps-4 mb-4'>
                <li>* TypeScript: NestJS is built with TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript provides static typing and additional language features that enhance code readability, maintainability, and tooling support.</li>
                <li>* Modularity: NestJS promotes a modular architecture where the application is divided into modules, each encapsulating a specific functionality. Modules help organize code and enable easy reusability and separation of concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className='text-2xl mb-4'>4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h3>
            <p className='font-semibold mb-4'>Here's how the aggregate operation works in MongoDB:</p>
            <ul className='ps-4 mb-4'>
                <li>1. Data Pipeline: The aggregate operation consists of one or more stages defined in an array. Each stage performs a specific data processing operation on the documents.</li>
                <p className='mt-4'>2. Stages: The aggregate pipeline stages can include the following:</p>
                <li>* match: Filters the documents based on specified criteria.</li>
                <li>* group: Groups the documents by a specified field and performs aggregations on the grouped data.</li>
                <li>* sort: Sorts the documents based on one or more fields.</li>
                <li>* project: Selects or transforms specific fields in the documents.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
